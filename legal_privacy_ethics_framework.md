## Legal, Privacy, and Ethical Framework (EU/Poland) for a Document-Heavy Investigative Portal

1) Purpose and scope — This framework sets binding guardrails for publishing nine Polish .txt source documents and per-article audio in a portal examining manipulation, toxicity, and institutional dynamics, balancing rigorous public-interest reporting with legal, privacy, and accessibility duties to build trust and minimize harm in a fragmented information environment [1](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf). The framework ensures compliance with Polish Press Law constraints and GDPR, while preserving evidentiary integrity and enabling responsible disclosure of sensitive material [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).

2) GDPR compliance (EU/Poland)
- Lawful basis (legitimate interests) and LIA: We rely on Article 6(1)(f) GDPR (legitimate interests) for investigative publication, subject to a documented three-part test: (i) a lawful, clearly articulated, real/present interest; (ii) strict necessity—no equally effective, less intrusive alternative; and (iii) a balancing test showing that data subjects’ rights and freedoms do not override our interests, all assessed case-by-case and documented before processing [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf). Controllers must inform data subjects of the legitimate interests relied upon and conduct the balancing test with methodology considering the nature/source of interest, reasonable expectations, impacts, and safeguards [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).
- Necessity, minimization, and transparency: Where legitimate interests are used, we confirm the interest cannot reasonably be achieved just as effectively by less intrusive means; if such means exist, Article 6(1)(f) cannot be relied upon [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf). We provide GDPR-compliant privacy notices (including the legal basis, recipients, retention, transfers, rights, and UODO complaint routes) in Polish for consumer-facing communications, with additional Polish-language expectations applicable in proceedings [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). Reasonable expectations are evaluated considering relationship, proximity, collection context, service nature, and confidentiality obligations; common practice alone does not establish expectations [5](https://www.iwp.edu/articles/2025/06/18/threats-to-media-freedom-and-pluralism-in-poland-after-2023/).
- Redaction standards and evidentiary integrity: To avoid doxxing and unlawful processing, we redact personal data and images of suspects, witnesses, and victims unless consent or competent authority permission is obtained and avoid publishing private-life information unless directly related to public activity, while annotating redactions to preserve evidentiary context [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002). In light of the portal’s constraint to preserve all files, originals are retained in a secure, immutable archival store with provenance notes, while public-facing versions apply lawful redactions and contextualization [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
- Data-subject rights and objections: Rights of access, rectification, erasure, and objection are honored with standard GDPR timelines; when a data subject objects on grounds related to their particular situation, processing ceases unless compelling legitimate grounds exist that override the data subject’s interests [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf). Certain public-task controllers may refuse access when necessary for task performance and if rights/freedoms are not superior or if classified information protection would be infringed, which is noted for interactions with public institutions [6](https://uodo.gov.pl/en/694).
- DPIA triggers and breach readiness: We conduct a DPIA where UODO lists the processing operation (e.g., monitoring or profiling) or otherwise presents high risk, maintain records of processing, and implement data protection by design/default [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). Breaches are notified to the supervisory authority without undue delay and, where feasible, within 72 hours, with “awareness” defined as reasonable certainty that a breach occurred; preliminary notifications are filed if investigations exceed 72 hours, with withdrawal if ultimately not notifiable [7](https://gdpr.pl/personal-data-breaches-and-notification-viewpoints-of-data-protecting-authorities).
- Special-category data and safeguards: Sensitive material (e.g., health, sexuality) is treated with heightened safeguards, risk assessment, and minimization, and may require DPIA and lawful redaction before publication where public-interest necessity is not met [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
- Vendors, cross-border transfers, and EU hosting: International transfers require appropriate safeguards (e.g., SCCs) and Transfer Impact Assessments; vendors are evaluated for privacy/security commitments, and EU-based hosting/CDNs are preferred to minimize transfer risk [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). Controllers should scrutinize third-country authority requests case-by-case, as mere avoidance of foreign sanctions may not override data subjects’ rights [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).

3) Polish Press Law and defamation safeguards
- Right of reply (sprostowanie): Editors must publish a factual correction of inaccurate or untrue information upon request by an interested person/entity, submitted within 21 days, including identity/address, concise formatting (not exceeding twice the size/time of the original fragment), and prompt publication with specified placement and typography; text cannot be altered without consent, and no commentary may accompany it in the same issue or on the same day electronically (a simple notice of forthcoming response is allowed) [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002). Electronic corrections must be published within 3 working days in e-form and labeled clearly (e.g., “Sprostowanie”) [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
- Publication constraints: It is prohibited to publish personal data and images of persons under preparatory or court proceedings, witnesses, or victims unless they consent or competent authorities permit disclosure; opinions on case outcomes are prohibited before a first-instance judgment [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002). Publishing information about the private sphere requires consent unless directly related to public activity; audio/visual publication requires consent from persons providing information [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
- Defamation due diligence: Criminal defamation (Article 212) protects external honor/good name and can be committed via text or mass media; civil remedies (injunctions, apologies, immaterial/material damages) also apply; permissible criticism and public-interest context can limit liability but require verification, contextual accuracy, and non-stigmatizing presentation, which must be documented in editorial files [8](https://www.dudkowiak.com/criminal-law-in-poland/defamation-in-poland).

4) Audio, cookies, and consent
- Accessible audio and transcripts: Provide an alternative for time-based media for prerecorded audio-only content (transcripts), ensure keyboard operability, visible focus, and controls for play/pause, seek, volume, mute, and rate; if any audio plays automatically for more than 3 seconds, provide immediate mechanisms to pause/stop or control volume [9](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/). Media players must be accessible to keyboard and screen reader users and support captions/transcripts and user customization [10](https://dequeuniversity.com/checklists/web/audio-video).
- UI targets and motion: Maintain minimum 24×24 CSS pixel target sizes for controls and adequate non-text contrast; avoid flashing and excessive motion, and provide pause/stop for any autoplay media [11](https://www.digitala11y.com/wcag-checklist/).
- Cookies and telemetry: Obtain opt-in consent for non-essential analytics or media cookies and present clear prior information; do not rely solely on browser settings for cookie consent under Polish law [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). Configure the audio player to function without non-essential tracking by default and only enable preference storage or telemetry after consent [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
- Children’s data: Apply heightened diligence for minors’ data, minimizing collection and applying clear consent and redaction safeguards where applicable under Polish data protection rules [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).

5) Ethical and trauma-informed presentation
- Language and tone: Use non-stigmatizing, precise language when addressing manipulation, toxic relationships, and narcissism; maintain a serious, analytical tone with predictable layouts and minimal motion to reduce cognitive load for sensitive content [12](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-design-principles/). Provide content warnings where distressing material may appear and avoid sensationalism to support reader safety and trust [12](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/homepage-design-principles/). Publicly disclose editorial standards, verification methods, and limitations to strengthen transparency and credibility in a low-trust environment [1](https://reutersinstitute.politics.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2025-06/Digital_News-Report_2025.pdf).

6) Operational checklists and templates
- GDPR/LIA checklist
  - Define and document a lawful, clearly articulated, real/present legitimate interest tied to public-interest reporting [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).
  - Necessity test: confirm no equally effective, less intrusive alternative exists for the same purpose [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).
  - Balancing test: assess impacts, reasonable expectations, and safeguards; record the outcome and inform data subjects of the reliance on legitimate interests [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).
  - Provide Polish-language privacy notices detailing rights, legal bases, recipients, retention, transfers, and UODO complaint routes [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
  - Conduct DPIA where UODO requires or risk is high; implement data protection by design/default; maintain records of processing [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
  - Breach readiness: define awareness thresholds, trigger 72-hour internal clock, and use preliminary notifications if investigations exceed 72 hours [7](https://gdpr.pl/personal-data-breaches-and-notification-viewpoints-of-data-protecting-authorities).
  - Vendors/transfers: execute SCCs/TIAs for non-EU services and prefer EU hosting/CDNs to mitigate transfer risk [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
- Press Law/right-of-reply workflow checklist
  - Intake: verify requester’s standing, identity, address, and timeliness (≤21 days); ensure the correction is concise (≤2× original fragment’s size/time) [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
  - Editorial handling: publish within prescribed timelines (including 3 working days for e-form), in the same section with specified typography, labeled “Sprostowanie,” without alterations or same-day commentary [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
  - Constraints: enforce consent/authority permissions for publishing personal data/images in proceedings, avoid pre-judgment opinions, and obtain consent for private-life information and audio/visual publication [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
- Minimal sample texts
  - Privacy notice highlights
    - We process personal data in the legitimate interests of public-interest investigative reporting, after a case-by-case balancing test and necessity analysis [3](https://www.edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2024-10/edpb_guidelines_202401_legitimateinterest_en.pdf).
    - You have rights of access, rectification, erasure, and objection; contact our DPO and you may lodge a complaint with the Polish DPA (UODO) [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
    - We may use EU-based service providers and, where transfers outside the EU occur, apply SCCs and conduct TIAs [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
    - This notice is available in Polish and English; the Polish version governs for Polish consumers [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).
  - Corrections/Right-of-Reply notice
    - If you believe a published statement is inaccurate or untrue, you may submit a factual correction (“sprostowanie”) within 21 days, including your identity and address; concise formatting rules apply, and we will publish promptly with prescribed placement and typography [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
    - We will not alter your correction without your consent and will refrain from commentary in the same issue or day in electronic form; a notice of forthcoming response may be provided [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).
  - Audio transcript disclosure
    - A text transcript is provided for each prerecorded audio analysis to ensure accessible, non-audio access for all users [9](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).
- Retention and archival approach
  - Original .txt files are preserved in a secure, immutable archive with provenance notes; public-facing versions apply necessary lawful redactions and annotations while maintaining contextual integrity [2](https://sciendo.com/pdf/10.1515/lape-2017-0002).

7) Governance and accountability
- Roles and gates: The Editor-in-Chief is accountable for editorial standards and Press Law compliance; the Data Protection Lead (DPO) oversees GDPR governance, DPIA/LIA documentation, breach readiness, and UODO liaison; a Legal Review Gate signs off on publication decisions involving high-risk personal data or sensitive allegations [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). Entities appointing a DPO must notify UODO within 14 days and make the DPO’s name and contact publicly available [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). 
- Logging and audits: Maintain audit logs of corrections/right-of-reply requests, redaction decisions, LIA/DPIA outcomes, and breach notifications to demonstrate accountability and enable supervisory review [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024). 
- Policy cadence: Review privacy, corrections, and audio accessibility policies at least annually or upon regulatory change; ensure Polish-language versions are updated in parallel and accessible to users [4](https://ceelegalmatters.com/data-protection-2024/poland-data-protection-2024).

Implementation notes: All nine source documents must be preserved and utilized; the portal presents them within categories while respecting redaction and consent constraints, and each article provides an accessible “▶ Listen to analysis” control with transcripts and consent-respecting media behavior [9](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/).
